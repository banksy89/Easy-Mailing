<h1>Contact Form.</h1>
<p>Handles the validation of a form. Takes any given columns you provide. Supports Email templating. Simple to use.</p>
<p><strong>A quick guide: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <ol>Place the folders in to your chosen destination</ol>
  <ol>Use <i>form.php</i> as an example of how to apply the form.</ol>
</ul>
<p>Still need to check the constants. As may revert back to just using a string within the handle_form. </p>
