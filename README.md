<h1>Making Contact Forms Easy.</h1>
<p>Just a simple contact form handling script, which I threw together quickly but works pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>To use: </strong></p>
<p>Form_action.php is the main function that processes the form, all you have to do is change the $cols array within it the the form element names you want to use…there is an example usage in form.php of how to use within a normal page.</p>
<p>This is based on a simple tempting system, so you set up your HTML email within Email.php and replace the tags ( in capitals ) to the same name as your form elements.</p>
<p>It all works pretty nicely; just for myself to use if I ever come across a static site that only needs a contact form - I can quickly throw this on there and be done with it!</p>
